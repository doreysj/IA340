For the Technical Career Track, applicants participate in a three-phase assessment process: You must successfully complete each phase to advance to the next phase. The total time commitment for the three phases is approximately 4 hours (many applicants require less time!). Before each phase, DHS will e-mail you instructions and information to help you prepare. Assessments are time sensitive, so monitor your e-mail to ensure you have plenty of time to complete them prior to any deadlines. PHASE I: ONLINE ASSESSMENTS Un-proctored - Completed online within a prescribed period of time. Includes two assessments: (1) a work styles inventory that will take about 30 minutes to complete; (2) a work simulation that you will have up to 2 hours to complete. The two assessments take about 90 minutes (on average) to complete. Requires a computer with audio (speakers or headphones) and a reliable internet connection. No knowledge of DHS or cybersecurity is required for these assessments, which measure non-technical capabilities that are important for professional success in the DHS-CS. This includes how you communicate, analyze information, and collaborate with others: The work styles inventory presents you with questions about your work-related interests and preferences. The work simulation presents you with realistic, work-related scenarios and asks you to respond to them. PHASE II: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT Proctored - must be scheduled in advance and completed at a designated assessment center within a prescribed period of time There is a different assessment for each DHS-CS technical capability (visit Jobs to learn more about the technical capabilities). Most individuals only have a primary technical capability and complete only one Technical Capability Assessment, but in limited circumstances, you may complete a second Technical Capability Assessment. You will have up to 2.5 hours to complete each Technical Capability Assessment; each takes about 90 minutes (on average) to complete. Assessments present realistic, work-related cybersecurity scenarios and questions to assess technical skills. Cybersecurity knowledge is assessed, but no knowledge of DHS is required. *Applicants who successfully complete Phase II will undergo a resume review to confirm required experience. Applicants who pass this review will be invited to participate in a Phase III: Advanced Technical Interview.

Salary Determination: The ODNI uses a rank-in-person system in which rank is attached to GS employees on the basis of individual qualifications, experience, and performance. Individuals whose current GS grade is equivalent to the grade of the advertised position will retain their current grade and step. Individuals who transfer to the ODNI from a non-GS pay scale will have base pay converted to the appropriate GS grade and step as determined by the Director/ Human Resource Management. On occasional instances when a current federal civilian employee applies for an ODNI position that is a lower grade than his or her personal grade, the candidate's personal grade will be downgraded to the grade of the advertised ODNI position and pay will be set at the step that is closest to but not less than the employee's current annual base rate of pay, not to exceed the maximum rate (i.e., step 10) of the GS grade to which assigned. Relocation Expenses: For new ODNI employees, reimbursement for relocation is discretionary based on availability of funds.

OR Combination of education and experience -- courses as shown above, plus appropriate experience or additional education. The experience should have included a full range of professional statistical work such as (a) sampling, (b) collecting, computing, and analyzing statistical data, and (c) applying statistical techniques such as measurement of central tendency, dispersion, skewness, sampling error, simple and multiple correlation, analysis of variance, and tests of significance. BASIC REQUIREMENTS GS-1529 MATHEMATICAL STATISTICIAN (Data Scientist): You must have a degree that included courses in mathematics and statistics totaling at least 24 semester hours. This course work must have included a minimum of 12 semester hours of mathematics and 6 semester hours were in statistics. Courses acceptable toward meeting the mathematics course requirement must have included at least four of the following: differential calculus, integral calculus, advanced calculus, theory of equations, vector analysis, advanced algebra, linear algebra, mathematical logic, differential equations, or any other advanced course in mathematics for which one of these was a prerequisite. Courses in mathematical statistics or probability theory with a prerequisite of elementary calculus or more advanced courses will be accepted toward meeting the mathematics requirements, with the provision that the same course cannot be counted toward both the mathematics and the statistics requirement. OR Combination of education and experience -- includes at least 24 semester hours of mathematics and statistics, including at least 12 hours in mathematics and 6 hours in statistics, as described above; and Experience that showed evidence of statistical work such as (a) sampling, (b) collecting, computing, and analyzing statistical data, and (c) applying known statistical techniques to data such as measurement of central tendency, dispersion, skewness, sampling error, simple and multiple correlation, analysis of variance, and tests of significance.
